# Video-Summarizer
This project automatically segments any .mp4 video into meaningful scenes and generates a structured HTML report with summaries and visuals.  It combines video scene detection, audio transcription using Whisper, NLP-based summarization, and keyframe extraction â€” all designed to run efficiently on CPU using Google Colab.
